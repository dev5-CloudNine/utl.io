                            Buyers are platform users who post projects, tasks and jobs that they would like completed.  As a buyer, you post the job you would like completed, set the terms, requirements, desired skills, and pricing on the platform and choose which provider you would like to perform the job listed.   Alternatively, you can directly offer a job to a provider of your choice to have it performed.

                            Providers are the backbone of the platform.  Whether they work as independent contractors or as employees of a business, they perform the work a Buyer would like to be done to their standards.  Providers range from different backgrounds, experience and skills.  As a provider, you can choose any job or project to your preferences, pricing, or what is most tailored to your skills.
