				<h2>How do Payments work?</h2>
				<p>“You set the price.   We’ll take care of everything else.”</p>

				<p>No matter how big or small your project is, or how big or small your budget is, when using our platform, YOU set the price for the job or project.  All projects are equally important, no matter the size.  As long as you have funds deposited on your account, you can freely post projects or jobs of any size or magnitude at whatever price point you wish. For more information on how our billing and payment system works you may visit the Payments option here through this link.
