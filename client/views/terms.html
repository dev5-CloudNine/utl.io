            <strong>3.6 MARKETPLACE FEEDBACK</strong>
            <p>You acknowledge and agree that feedback benefits the marketplace, all Users, and the efficiency of the Site and you specifically request that USTECHLAND post composite or compiled feedback about Users, including yourself, on User Profiles and elsewhere on the Site. You acknowledge and agree that feedback results for you, if any, will consist of comments, ratings, indicators of User satisfaction, and other feedback left by other Users. You further acknowledge and agree that USTECHLAND will make feedback results available to other marketplace Users, including composite or compiled feedback.

            <p>The Site is a job management website to connect freelancers with potential job opportunities. Subject to the Terms of Service, USTECHLAND provides the Site Services to Users, including hosting and maintaining the Site, enabling the formation of Service Contracts, and coordinating disputes related to those Service Contracts. If Users agree on terms for Provider Services, a Service Contract is formed directly between such Users. When a User enters a Service Contract, the User uses the Site to engage, communicate, invoice and pay online.</p>
            <strong>4.1 deposit account</strong>

After entering into a Service Contract, the first time a Buyer makes a payment for an Engagement, USTECHLAND will establish and maintain a “Buyer Deposit” to hold funds for the Buyer to use to make payments for Engagements, to receive refunds in connection with Engagements, and to make payments to USTECHLAND for payment processing and transaction fees.</p>
            <p>(b) Provider Deposit. After entering into a Service Contract, the first time a Provider uses the Site to receive payment for an Engagement, USTECHLAND will establish and maintain a “Provider Deposit” for the Provider to receive payments for Engagements, pay transaction fees to USTECHLAND, and issue refunds to Buyers.</p>
            <p>You hereby authorize and instruct USTECHLAND to act as agent in connection with the payment, holding, and receipt of funds for each Engagement in accordance with the Terms of Service.</p>

            <h2 class="page-header">5. CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BUYER AND PROVIDER</h2>
            <p>You acknowledge and agree that a Service Contract is comprised of: (a) the Engagement terms awarded and accepted on the Site to the extent that the terms do not, and do not purport to, expand USTECHLAND’s obligations or restrict USTECHLAND’s rights under the Terms of Service; (b) the terms in Section 8 (Service Contract Terms), unless other terms are agreed to by the parties, to the extent that the provisions do not, and do not purport to, expand USTECHLAND’s obligations or restrict USTECHLAND’s rights under the Terms of Service; and (c) any other contractual provisions accepted by both the Buyer and the Provider, to the extent that the provisions do not, and do not purport to, expand USTECHLAND’s obligations or restrict USTECHLAND’s rights under the Terms of Service. You acknowledge and agree that USTECHLAND is not a party to any Service Contracts, and that the formation of a Service Contract between Users will not, under any circumstance, create an employment or other service relationship between USTECHLAND and any Provider.</p>

            <h2 class="page-header">6. PAYMENT TERMS</h2>
            <strong>6.1 transaction FEE</strong>
            <p>The fees to use the Site and Site Services (the “Transaction Fee”) are paid either by the Provider or the Buyer. The User responsible for paying the Transaction Fee is determined by the terms of the Service Contract between the Buyer and the Provider. If the obligation to pay the Transaction Fee is on the Buyer, USTECHLAND will deduct an amount equal to the Transaction Fee from the Deposit Account of the Buyer in addition to the amount due to the Provider under the Service Contract and place the combined amount on hold. If the obligation to pay the Transaction Fee is on the, USTECHLAND will deduct the Transaction Fee from the amount payable to the Provider when the Provider is paid.</p>
            <strong>6.2 NO FEE FOR INTRODUCING OR FOR FINDING ENGAGEMENTS</strong>
            <p>USTECHLAND does not introduce Buyers to Providers and does not help Providers secure Engagements. USTECHLAND merely makes the Site Services available to enable Providers to do so themselves. Therefore, USTECHLAND does not charge a fee when a Provider finds a suitable Buyer or finds an Engagement. However, a Buyer and a Provider are obligated to use the Site to pay and receive payment for their work together if they identified each other through the Site, as detailed in Section 7 (Non-Circumvention), below. In addition, USTECHLAND does not charge any fee or dues for posting public feedback and composite or compiled feedback.</p>
            <strong>6.3 DISBURSEMENTS TO PROVIDERS</strong>
            <p>Under the relevant  Instructions, USTECHLAND disburses funds that are payable to a Provider for the Engagement (less any applicable USTECHLAND fees) to Providers within 3 days of the Provider choosing to withdraw Deposit Funds via the Site. Provider agrees that it will not receive interest or other earnings on the funds held by USTECHLAND prior to disbursement to Provider.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of the Terms of Service or the  Instructions, and except as prohibited by applicable law, if we determine in our sole discretion that you have violated the conditions and restrictions of the Site or the Terms of Service, USTECHLAND may hold the disbursement of the Provider Fees. Additionally, USTECHLAND may also hold the disbursement of the Provider Fees if: (a) we require additional information, such as Provider’s tax information, government-issued identification, address, or date of birth; (b) we have reason to believe the Provider Fees may be subject to dispute or chargeback; (c) we suspect fraud; (d) we believe there are reasonable grounds for insecurity with respect to the performance of obligations under a Service Contract or this Terms of Service; (e) we deem it necessary in connection with any investigation; or (f) required by applicable law.</p>
            <p>In cases of fraud, abuse, or violation of the Terms of Service, USTECHLAND reserves the right to revoke any payments, hold and reclaim all Provider Fees due to Provider (not just the Provider Fees from the Service Contract(s) under investigation) unless prohibited by applicable law. In addition, we reserve the right to seek reimbursement from you, and you will reimburse us, if we suspect fraud or criminal activity associated with your payment, withdrawal, or Engagement; if we discover erroneous or duplicate transactions; or if we have supplied our services in accordance with this Agreement yet we receive any charge-back from the Payment Method used by you, or used by your Buyer if you are a Provider. Failure to pay for reimbursements of charge-backs is cause for termination of the applicable Deposit Account and revocation of your access to the Site.</p>
            <strong>6.4 FORMAL INVOICES AND TAXES</strong>
            <p>USTECHLAND will have no responsibility for determining the necessity of or for issuing any formal invoices, or for determining, remitting, or withholding any taxes applicable to the Provider Fees. Provider will be solely responsible for determining whether it is required by applicable law to issue any formal invoices for the Provider Fees and for issuing any invoices so required. Provider will also be solely responsible for determining whether: (a) Provider or USTECHLAND is required by applicable law to remit to the appropriate authorities any value added tax or any other taxes or similar charges applicable to the Provider Fees and remitting any such taxes or charges to the appropriate authorities on behalf of itself or USTECHLAND, as appropriate; and (b) USTECHLAND is required by applicable law to withhold any amount of the Provider Fees and for notifying USTECHLAND of any such requirement and indemnifying USTECHLAND (either by USTECHLAND, at our sole discretion, offsetting the relevant amount against a future payment of Provider Fees to Provider or Provider reimbursing USTECHLAND for the applicable amount) for any requirement to pay any withholding amount to the appropriate authorities (including penalties and interest). In the event of an audit of USTECHLAND, Provider agrees to promptly cooperate with USTECHLAND and provide copies of Provider’s tax returns and other documents as may be reasonably requested for purposes of such audit, including but not limited to records showing Provider is engaging in an independent business as represented to USTECHLAND.</p>
            <strong>6.5 PAYMENT METHODS</strong>
            <p>In order to use certain Site Services, Buyer must provide account information for at least one valid Payment Method.</p>
            <p>Buyer hereby authorizes USTECHLAND, to run credit card authorizations on all credit cards provided by Buyer, to store credit card and banking or other financial details as Buyer’s method of payment for Services, and to charge Buyer’s credit card (or any other Payment Method).</p>
            <p>By providing Payment Method information through the Site, Buyer represents, warrants, and covenants that: (a) Buyer is legally authorized to provide such information; (b) Buyer is legally authorized to perform payments using the Payment Method(s); and (c) such action does not violate the terms and conditions applicable to Buyer’s use of such Payment Method(s) or applicable law. When Buyer authorizes a payment using a Payment Method via the Site, Buyer represents, warrants, and covenants that there are sufficient funds or credit available to complete the payment using the designated Payment Method. To the extent that any amounts owed under this Terms of Service cannot be collected from Buyer’s Payment Method(s), Buyer is solely responsible for paying such amounts by other means.</p>

            <h2 class="page-header">8. SERVICE CONTRACT TERMS</h2>
            <p>Unless otherwise expressly agreed to in writing by both Users, the default terms and conditions of the Service Contract that a Provider enters directly with a Buyer when the Provider agrees to provide Provider Services to the Buyer are as set forth in this Section 8. Users may agree between them on any additional or different terms for their Service Contract as long as such terms do not and do not purport to affect the rights or responsibilities of USTECHLAND or violate the Terms of Service. USTECHLAND is not a party to any Service Contract by or between Users.</p>
            <p>Users agree that the terms concerning the Service Contract described on the Site, including Provider Fees, rates, hours, and milestones, form part of the Service Contract. Users agree to obtain the consent of the other before making changes to the Service Contract by adding additional or different milestones or making other changes to the Service Contract on the Site. If consent of the other party is not first obtained, the other party may reject such changes by terminating the Service Contract (see Section 8.3) or accept such changes by continuing to work on the Service Contract.</p>
            <strong>8.1 SERVICES</strong>
            <p>Provider will perform the Provider Services in a professional and workmanlike manner and will timely deliver any agreed upon Work Product. The manner and means of performing the Provider Services will be determined and controlled solely by Provider, which is engaged by Buyer as an independent contractor.</p>
            <strong>8.2 BUYER PAYMENTS AND BILLING</strong>
            <p>Buyer becomes obligated for Provider Fees once Provider has completed the Engagement to the satisfaction of the Buyer and Buyer has signalled approval on the Site.</p>
            <strong>8.3 TERMINATION OF A SERVICE CONTRACT</strong>
            <p>Under Hourly Contracts, either Buyer or Provider has the right to terminate the Service Contract after providing any required notice, or immediately on the end date specified in the Service Contract terms and/or upon completion of the Provider Services, in the event of a material breach, or with the consent of the other party. Except as required by law, Buyer remains obligated to pay the Provider Fees for any Provider Services provided prior to termination of the Hourly Contract.</p>
            <strong>8.4 WORKER CLASSIFICATION</strong>
            <p>Buyer is responsible and assumes all liability for determining whether Providers are independent contractors or employees and engaging them accordingly; USTECHLAND disclaims any liability for such determination or the related Engagement. The Terms of Service do not create a partnership or agency relationship between Users. Provider does not have authority to enter into written or oral (whether implied or express) contracts on behalf of USTECHLAND. For Service Contracts classified as independent contractor relationships, Buyer may not require an exclusive relationship. A Provider classified as an independent contractor is free at all times to provide Provider Services to persons or businesses other than Buyer, including any competitor of Buyer.</p>

            <p>USTECHLAND is not a party to the dealings between Buyer and Provider, including posts, proposals, screening, selection, contracting, and performance of Provider Services. USTECHLAND does not introduce Providers to Buyers or help Providers find Engagements. USTECHLAND merely makes the Site Services available to enable Providers to identify and determine the suitability of Buyers for themselves and to enable Buyers to identify and determine the suitability of Providers for themselves. USTECHLAND does not, in any way, supervise, direct, or control Provider or Provider’s work. USTECHLAND does not set Provider’s work hours, work schedules, or location of work, nor is USTECHLAND involved in determining if the Provider Fees will be set at an hourly or fixed rate for a Service Contract. USTECHLAND will not provide Provider with training or any equipment, labor, or materials needed for a particular Service Contract. USTECHLAND does not provide the premises at which the Provider will perform the work. USTECHLAND makes no representations about, and does not guarantee the quality, safety, or legality of, the Provider Services; the truth or accuracy of Provider’s listings on the Site; the qualifications, background, or identities of Users; the ability of Providers to deliver the Provider Services; the ability of Buyers to pay for the Provider Services; or that a Buyer or Provider can or will actually complete a transaction.</p>
            <p>USTECHLAND does not deduct any amount for withholding, unemployment, Social Security, or other taxes for Buyer or Provider, each of which is solely responsible for all tax returns and payments required to be filed with or made to any federal, state, or local tax authority in any nation with respect to Provider’s performance, and Buyer’s acceptance, of Provider Services.</p>
            <p>USTECHLAND is not required to and may not verify any feedback or information given to us by Providers or Buyers, nor does USTECHLAND perform background checks on Providers or Buyers.</p>
            <strong>You hereby acknowledge and agree that USTECHLAND may provide information on the Site about a Provider or Buyer, such as feedback, composite feedback, geographical location, or verification of identity or credentials.  However, such information is based solely on data that Providers or Buyers voluntarily submit to USTECHLAND and does not constitute and will not be construed as an introduction, endorsement, or recommendation by USTECHLAND; USTECHLAND provides such information solely for the convenience of Users.</strong>

            <h2 class="page-header">20. AGREEMENT TERM AND TERMINATION</h2>
            <p>The Terms of Service as amended from time to time, will become effective on the later of the Effective Date or your first visit to the Site and will remain in effect for the duration of your use of the Site or Site Services. Unless both you and USTECHLAND expressly agree otherwise in writing, either of us may terminate this Agreement in our sole discretion, at any time, without explanation, upon written notice to the other, which will result in the termination of the other Terms of Service as well, except as otherwise provided herein. You may provide written notice to support@USTECHLAND.com. In the event you properly terminate this Agreement, your right to use the Site is automatically revoked, and your Account will be closed; however, (a) if you have any open Engagements when you terminate this Agreement, you will continue to be bound by this Terms of Service until all such Engagements have closed on the Site; (b) USTECHLAND will continue to perform those Site Services necessary to complete any open Engagement or related transaction between you and another User; and (c) you will continue to be obligated to pay any amounts accrued but unpaid as of the date of termination or as of the completion of any open Engagements, whichever is later, to USTECHLAND for any Site Services and to any Providers for any Provider Services. Without limiting any other provisions of the Terms of Service, the termination of this Agreement for any reason will not release you, any User with whom you have entered into a Service Contract, or USTECHLAND from any obligations incurred prior to termination of this Agreement or that thereafter may accrue in respect of any act or omission prior to such termination. Those portions of the Terms of Service necessary to implement the foregoing survive termination of this Agreement for any reason.</p>
            <p>Without limiting USTECHLAND’s other rights or remedies, we may temporarily suspend, indefinitely suspend, or permanently revoke your access to the Site and refuse to provide any or all Site Services to you if: (i) you breach the letter or spirit of any terms and conditions of this Agreement or other parts of the Terms of Service; (ii) we suspect or become aware that you have provided false or misleading information to us; or (iii) we believe, in our sole discretion, that your actions may cause legal liability for you, our Users, or USTECHLAND or our Affiliates; may be contrary to the interests of the Site or the User community; or may involve illicit activity. If your Account is suspended or closed, you may not use the Site under the same Account or a different Account or reregister under a new Account without USTECHLAND’s prior written consent. If you attempt to use the Site under a different Account, we reserve the right to reclaim available funds in that Account and/or use an available Payment Method to pay for any amounts owed by you to the extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
            <p>Without limiting USTECHLAND’s other rights or remedies, if you engage in actions or activities that circumvent the Site or otherwise reduce fees owed USTECHLAND or our Affiliates under the Terms of Service, you must pay USTECHLAND, and you authorize USTECHLAND or its Affiliate to charge you, for all fees owed to USTECHLAND and our Affiliates and reimburse USTECHLAND for all losses and costs (including any and all time of USTECHLAND’s employees) and reasonable expenses (including attorneys’ fees) related to investigating such breach and collecting such fees. In addition, violations of the Terms of Service may be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and may result in additional penalties and sanctions.</p>
            <p>If your Account is closed for any reason, you will no longer have access to data, messages, files, and other material you keep on the Site. If practicable or required by law, USTECHLAND will retain this information along with all your previous posts and proposals for a period of up to five years from the date of closure. However, you understand that any closure of your Account may involve deletion of any content stored in your Account for which USTECHLAND will have no liability whatsoever.</p>
            <strong>20.1 ENFORCEMENT OF AGREEMENT</strong>
            <p>USTECHLAND has the right, but not the obligation, to suspend or revoke your access to the Site and Site Services if we believe that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of this Terms of Service or violated our rights or those of another party. Without limiting USTECHLAND’s other rights or remedies, we may suspend or close your Account, use self-help in connection with our rights to reclaim funds, and refuse to provide any further access to the Site or the Services to you if (a) you breach any terms and conditions of this Terms of Service; (b) we are unable to verify or authenticate any information you provide to us; or (c) we believe that your actions may cause legal liability for you, other Users, or USTECHLAND.</p>
            <strong>20.2 CONSEQUENCES OF AGREEMENT TERMINATION</strong>
            <p>Termination of this Agreement and/or closing of your Account will not relieve Buyer of the requirement to pay for Provider Services performed prior to the Effective Date of the termination or thereafter for any Service Contracts executed before termination of this Agreement, which fees and expenses, together with any applicable taxes, Buyer hereby authorizes USTECHLAND to charge.</p>
            <p>Except as otherwise required by applicable law, we will notify you if we close your Account, unless we believe, in our sole judgment, that giving notice may cause damage. You acknowledge and agree that the value, reputation, and goodwill of the Site depend on transparency of User’s Account status to all Users, including both yourself and other Users who have entered into Service Contracts with you. You therefore agree as follows: <strong>IF USTECHLAND DECIDES TO SUSPEND OR CLOSE YOUR ACCOUNT, USTECHLAND HAS THE RIGHT BUT NOT THE OBLIGATION TO: (A) NOTIFY OTHER USERS THAT HAVE ENTERED INTO SERVICE CONTRACTS WITH YOU TO INFORM THEM OF YOUR SUSPENDED OR CLOSED ACCOUNT STATUS, AND (B) PROVIDE THOSE USERS WITH A SUMMARY OF THE REASONS FOR YOUR ACCOUNT SUSPENSION OR CLOSURE.</strong></p>
            <strong>20.3 SURVIVAL</strong>
            <p>After this Agreement terminates, the terms of the Terms of Service that expressly or by their nature contemplate performance after the Agreement terminates or expires will survive and continue in full force and effect. For example, the provisions protecting Confidential Information, requiring arbitration, permitting audits, protecting intellectual property, requiring non-circumvention, indemnification, payment of fees, reimbursement and setting forth limitations of liability each, by their nature, contemplate performance or observance after this Agreement terminates.</p>

Any Notice from you must include your name, pertinent account information, a brief description of the Claim, and your contact information, so that we may evaluate the Claim and attempt to informally resolve the Claim.

Both you and USTECHLAND will have 30 days from the date of the receipt of the Notice to informally resolve the other party’s Claim, which, if successful, will avoid the need for further action.</p>

            <h2 class="page-header">22. GENERAL</h2>
            <strong>22.1 ENTIRE AGREEMENT</strong>
            <p>This Terms of Service, sets forth the entire agreement and understanding between you and USTECHLAND relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof and cancels and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous discussions, agreements, representations, warranties, and other communications between you and us, written or oral, to the extent they relate in any way to the subject matter hereof and thereof. The section headings in the Terms of Service are included for ease of reference only and have no binding effect. Even though USTECHLAND drafted the Terms of Service, you represent that you had ample time to review and decide whether to agree to the Terms of Service. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation of the Terms of Service arises, no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring you or USTECHLAND because of the authorship of any provision of the Terms of Service.</p>
            <strong>22.2 SIDE AGREEMENTS</strong>
            <p>Notwithstanding subsection 22.1 (Entire Agreement), Buyers and Providers may enter into any supplemental or other written agreements that they deem appropriate (e.g., confidentiality agreements, invention assignment agreements, assignment of rights, etc.). The terms and conditions of the Terms of Service, however, will govern and supersede any term or condition in a side agreement that purports to expand USTECHLAND’s obligations or restrict USTECHLAND’s rights under the Terms of Service.</p>
            <strong>22.3 COMPLIANCE</strong>
            <p>User will not violate any applicable foreign, federal, state, or local laws or third-party rights on or related to the Site. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, User agrees to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, import and export control laws and third parties’ Intellectual Property Rights.</p>
            <strong>22.4 MODIFICATIONS</strong>
            <p>No modification or amendment to the Terms of Service will be binding upon USTECHLAND unless in a written instrument signed by a duly authorized representative of USTECHLAND. For the purposes of this subsection, a written instrument will expressly exclude electronic communications, such as email and electronic notices. This Section 22.4 (Modifications) does not apply to amendments to the Terms of Service posted by USTECHLAND to the Site from time to time.</p>
            <strong>22.5 NO WAIVER</strong>
            <p>The failure or delay of either party to exercise or enforce any right or claim does not constitute a waiver of such right or claim and will in no way affect that party’s right to later enforce or exercise it, unless such party issues an express written waiver, signed by a duly authorized representative of such party.</p>
            <strong>22.6 ASSIGNABILITY</strong>
            <p>User may not assign the Terms of Service, or any of its rights or obligations hereunder, without USTECHLAND’s prior written consent in the form of a written instrument signed by a duly authorized representative of USTECHLAND (and, for the purposes of this subsection, a written instrument will expressly exclude electronic communications such as email and electronic notices, but will include facsimiles). USTECHLAND may freely assign this Terms of Service without User’s consent. Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of this subsection will be null and void. Subject to the foregoing restrictions, the Terms of Service will inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the parties.</p>
            <strong>22.7 SEVERABILITY</strong>
            <p>If and to the extent any provision of the Terms of Service is held illegal, invalid, or unenforceable in whole or in part under applicable law, such provision or such portion thereof will be ineffective as to the jurisdiction in which it is illegal, invalid, or unenforceable to the extent of its illegality, invalidity, or unenforceability and will be deemed modified to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law so as to give the maximum effect to the intent of the parties. The illegality, invalidity, or unenforceability of such provision in that jurisdiction will not in any way affect the legality, validity, or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction or of any other provision in any jurisdiction.</p>
            <strong>22.8 FORCE MAJEURE</strong>
            <p>The parties to this Agreement will not be responsible for the failure to perform or any delay in performance of any obligation hereunder due to labor disturbances, accidents, fires, floods, telecommunications or Internet failures, strikes, wars, riots, rebellions, blockades, acts of government, governmental requirements and regulations or restrictions imposed by law or any other similar conditions beyond the reasonable control of such party. The time for performance of such party will be extended by the period of such delay. Irrespective of any extension of time, if an event of Force Majeure occurs and its effect continues for a period of 60 days, either the party may give to the other a 30-day notice of termination. If, at the end of the 30 day period, the effect of the Force Majeure continues, the Terms of Service will terminate, except as provided in Section 20.3.</p>
